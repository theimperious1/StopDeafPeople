# Stop Deaf People today!
Are you tired of being kept awake by annoyingly loud Google Chromecasts that your friends or family can't seem to realize is so fucking loud it's damaging not only their hearing, but yours? Oh man, do I have the solution for you!

Simply configure the variables at the top of main.py, and run the program to force them into compliance with Shadow's Hearing and Sleep Safety protocols.

Never again will you have to suffer the tyranny of the hearing impaired!


Future plans:  
Silence zones  
Discord Bot Integration.

Why are these two things part of your future plans? The idea is if you're being kept awake you can issue a bot command and for the next XYZ amount of time, the volume will be forced into compliance.  
  
This makes for a nice compromise. If your friend or family is torturing you because of Tinnitus, this will allow you a window to get to sleep and for them to turn it back up and cope with their problems, just like you're doing by using this program!
